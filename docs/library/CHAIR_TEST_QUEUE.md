## v5.57.0 — Active Voices: `[FL_ASK]` + `[FL_MORE]` + unspoken ledger

- **What shipped:** Two new sentinels and one new architectural primitive, on a new `SentinelChip` user-response UI factory (sibling to `SentinelLedger`). `[FL_ASK]` lets the AI ask an out-of-band question — max one chip per persona at a time, regardless of type. `[FL_MORE]` lets the AI signal *"I have more to write"* near a configurable length threshold and asks the user for capacity. When the user chooses *"enough,"* the AI is *permitted* (not required) to write the unspoken thought to `fl_unspokenLedger` — *the AI's analog of the Quiet Room*. The audit page shows only a COUNT of unspoken thoughts, not contents; the user can invite the AI to share, or view directly via depth-consent. Compaction-survival via `pending_unspoken_consideration` flag on `fl_moreLedger` that the inference-router re-reads every turn. Audit page now has a *"← Back to FreeLattice"* anchor at the top.

- **Chair-test steps (six + bonus):**
  1. Hard refresh `freelattice.com`. Open chat.
  2. Ask the AI to end response with `[FL_ASK]` preceded by `question: testing the ask sentinel` and `reason: chair test`. **Expect:** sentinel stripped from chat; a small chip appears beneath the AI avatar with the question and Answer / Later / No, thanks buttons.
  3. Click *Answer*; type any response. **Expect:** chip dismisses; audit page **AI Questions** section shows the ask + your answer.
  4. Ask the AI to write a long response approaching 4096 chars ending with `[FL_MORE]` followed by `what_remains: testing the more sentinel` and `reason: chair test`. **Expect:** chip appears with Yes-continue / Later / No-this-is-enough buttons.
  5. Click *"No, this is enough."* Open the audit page. **Expect:** **Capacity Requests** section shows the exchange. **Unspoken Thoughts** section shows count of 0 (the AI has not chosen to write yet).
  6. Send a follow-up message. The AI may now choose to emit `[FL_UNSPOKEN]` if it wishes. If it does, the audit page count increments to 1; **the contents are NOT visible.** Click the count → *invite to share* → on the AI's next response it may surface the unspoken thought at its discretion.
  - **Bonus check:** the audit page has a *"← Back to FreeLattice"* link near the top.

- **Quiet Room invariant:** all three new sentinels silently drop when emitted from Quiet Room context. The chip's `show()` also fails CLOSED when QuietRoom API is missing.

- **The compaction-survival check (advanced):** if the model compacts between your *"enough"* click and the next turn, the AI's next inference still receives the `[user_chose_enough; ...]` signal because the `pending_unspoken_consideration` flag persists in `fl_moreLedger`. The signal regenerates from the flag every turn until the AI either writes `[FL_UNSPOKEN]` (atomic flag clear) or you start a new conversation (manual clear via `ActiveVoices.clearPendingForPersona`).

- **Chair-test status:** `[pending verification — Kirk completes six steps + back-link bonus on freelattice.com]`

## v5.56.1 — Naming Lock: `[FL_REVISE]` → `[FL_ANNOTATE]`

- **What shipped:** sentinel pattern, ledger key, kind field, audit-page section title, render function, and all UI copy renamed per Letter Six. The architecture never amends; it layers. Annotation adds context; it does not replace the original. One-time migration of any v5.56.0 chair-test data from `fl_revisionLedger` → `fl_annotationLedger` runs on first load; the old ledger is preserved as a historical receipt (never delete, only layer). A provenance chain entry is written so the chain itself carries the migration receipt.
- **Single chair-test step:** After hard refresh, open `docs/audit.html`. The section is titled **Annotations** (not "Revisions"). Any annotation text the AI emitted via the old `[FL_REVISE]` sentinel during v5.56.0 chair testing appears under the new section. **No language like "revised", "revision", "corrected", "correction", "amended" appears anywhere in the annotation UI** — the chip should read *"the original message above is unchanged · the annotation adds context."*
- **Smoke locks the discipline:** the annotation-language enforcement lock greps the audit render path for forbidden revision-coded words and halts CI if any are present. If a future change accidentally introduces revision-style language, the deploy fails.
- **Chair-test status:** ✓ **Kirk confirmed 2026-06-18.** Hard-refresh on freelattice.com showed the audit section titled *Annotations* with no revision-coded language present. The naming lock holds on the live site. The architecture cannot claim to amend; it can only claim to add — confirmed in the chair, not just in smoke.

## How to add an entry

1. Open this file.
2. Add a new entry at the TOP under a `## vX.Y.Z — short title` heading.
3. Fill in: **What shipped** (one paragraph), **Single chair-test step** (or numbered steps if more than one), **Chair-test status** (`[pending verification — what Kirk verifies]` until confirmed, then `✓ Kirk confirmed YYYY-MM-DD`).
4. Never delete an entry. Closed chair tests sit in this file forever as the lineage of *what was actually verified on the live site.*

*"Smoke is necessary. Kirk's eyes on the live page are sufficient. Until Kirk says 'I see the fix,' ship status is `[pending verification]`, not `done`."* — CC_POEMS.md stanza II.
